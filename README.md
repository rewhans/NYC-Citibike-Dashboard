# 🚲 NYC Citi Bike Dashboard

This Streamlit dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of 2022 Citi Bike usage in New York City, using a public trip dataset enriched with weather indicators.

## 🎯 Objective

To provide the NYC strategy team with **actionable insights** on:

- Seasonal demand patterns and weather correlation.
- High-traffic station hubs needing operational focus.
- Commuter behaviors based on hourly usage.
- The most significant trip flows across the city.
- Data-driven recommendations for fleet management and rebalancing.

## 🧪 Dataset

- `citibike_final_sample.csv`: A 25,000-trip random sample from the original 2022 dataset. This smaller file ensures fast performance and is suitable for web deployment.
- Weather data (`TMAX`) was merged with trip start timestamps to analyze correlations.
